**Disclaimer**: This is my journey to getting started with frontend although I am a backend engineer and so to this is just a start and by no means the endgame.

## Introduction

To get started with frontend development it is very important to understand how the browser works although that could be learnt later so then the first step is to understand the language of the frontend.

There are 3 major languages/technologies being used:
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/): Cascading Style Sheets
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML): Hyper Text Markup Language
- [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)

The attached links reference mozilla docs where you can look for more info about each language

## HTML

To get started with frontend we have to start with HTML.
