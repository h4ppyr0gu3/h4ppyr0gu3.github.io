      This app uses the youtube API to get search results of youtube videos,<br/>
      It then gives the user the opportunity to watch the youtube video in an iframe and download the video 
      which uses background workers to download asynchronously and clean the title as best as it possibly can 
      it scrapes wikipedia to find artists and their respective genres, it then allows the user to confirm the artists
      and title as it isn't a perfect system, if the user is logged in it is added to the users tracks
      there are future improvements i'd like to work on listed in the <a href="https://github.com/h4ppyr0gu3/musicApp"
